World Government Type: This world has government type 9 (Impersonal Bureaucracy). Rule by impersonal agencies isolated from the governed populations
World Government Detail: The government is an impersonal bureaucracy. Certain positions in the cabinet may be reserved for bureaucrats such as army officers; the government will fall apart if these agency leaders refuse to serve. If the bureaucracy is united this gives it a complete veto over any policy it doesn't like. (Japan suffered under this arrangement in the 1930s.) While the real power rests with an impersonal bureaucracy, the apparent political leadership is a Monarchy. Ultimate executive power rests in the hands of a hereditary monarch. There may also be a weak legislature of some sort, made up of hereditary peers, elected representatives or 'advisors' appointed directly by the monarch. Bureaucratized monarchies tend to be much more 'open' and meritocratic than the more aristocratic monarchies found under government type 3 (self-perpetuating oligarchy).

Technology Level explanation: The overall Technology Level (TL) of this world is 9. In the Traveller Universe, this is equivalent to approximately 2050 CE. The latest energy in use might include early fusion. Society has evolved to include superpowers. Typical living environments include arcologies. The lastest communication devices used by the citizenry are 3D images and video. Transport has advanced to NAFAL. The latest thing in medicine is cryogenics and fast drug. Science is developing gravitics, and the latest local technology includes fluidics. The latest available computer is Model/3. The fastest speed is done by civil SST, equivalent to Speed 11 (2000 kph). Commonly used personal weapons include accelerator weapons. Heavier military grade weapons at this technology level include autocannon, multiple missile launchers, RAM grenades. Space travel is accomplished by G-drive-4, Power Plant-2, M-drive-1, NAFAL-1, Jump-1. The latest weapon in space is the slug thrower, and space defenses are sandcaster. Space sensors used at this technology level are scope, radar, while world sensors used by starships now include analyser / sniffer, deep radar.

World Government Type: This world has government type 7 (Balkanization). Rival governments compete for control
World Government Detail: Years ago, either the Imperium or a megacorporation wanted to purchase some territory on this world (for a Naval or Scout base, for a research station, a mining colony or whatever). When the local government refused to make a deal, these outside interests organized a phony 'revolution' in that territory. A new government was established there, and it was immediately recognized by the Imperium. The world has remained divided to this day. There are 3 states on this world. The conflict level is High. The world is in the grip of a cold war between rival powers. Military spending is high, and there is a sense that a hot war between the major powers could break out at any time. For the moment, though, competition is channeled into low-intensity conflicts (largely revolutions and civil wars) within smaller, less powerful states, and direct superpower confrontation is avoided.These are the characteristics each state: Nation 1: This nation has government type 1 (Company / Corporation: Rule by a managerial elite). The local law level is 4. There is a local starport of class Y. The local technology level is 4. No one speaks Anglic as their first language, and very few (if any) speak it at all. The local language spoken is Creole mix of Anglic and some other language (roll a second time to determine) Nation 2: This nation has government type 4 (Representative Democracy: Government by proxy). The local law level is 5. There is a local starport of class Y. The local technology level is 4. No one speaks Anglic as their first language, and very few (if any) speak it at all. The local language spoken is Old Terran language. Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Mandarin are common. Nation 3: This nation has government type 5 (Feudal Technocracy: Governmental relationships based on mutually beneficial technical activities). The local law level is 2. There is a local starport of class Y. The local technology level is 4. The world's elite speak Anglic, perhaps as their first language, but the majority speaks something else. The local language spoken is Artificial language. An invented language such as Esperanto or Basic English.

World Government Type: This world has government type 9 (Impersonal Bureaucracy). Rule by impersonal agencies isolated from the governed populations
World Government Detail: The government is an impersonal bureaucracy. Certain positions in the cabinet may be reserved for bureaucrats such as army officers; the government will fall apart if these agency leaders refuse to serve. If the bureaucracy is united this gives it a complete veto over any policy it doesn't like. (Japan suffered under this arrangement in the 1930s.) While the real power rests with an impersonal bureaucracy, the apparent political leadership is a Monarchy. Ultimate executive power rests in the hands of a hereditary monarch. There may also be a weak legislature of some sort, made up of hereditary peers, elected representatives or 'advisors' appointed directly by the monarch. Bureaucratized monarchies tend to be much more 'open' and meritocratic than the more aristocratic monarchies found under government type 3 (self-perpetuating oligarchy).

World Government Type: This world has government type 7 (Balkanization). Rival governments compete for control
World Government Detail: Years ago, either the Imperium or a megacorporation wanted to purchase some territory on this world (for a Naval or Scout base, for a research station, a mining colony or whatever). When the local government refused to make a deal, these outside interests organized a phony 'revolution' in that territory. A new government was established there, and it was immediately recognized by the Imperium. The world has remained divided to this day. There are 3 states on this world. The conflict level is High. The world is in the grip of a cold war between rival powers. Military spending is high, and there is a sense that a hot war between the major powers could break out at any time. For the moment, though, competition is channeled into low-intensity conflicts (largely revolutions and civil wars) within smaller, less powerful states, and direct superpower confrontation is avoided.These are the characteristics each state: Nation 1: This nation has government type 1 (Company / Corporation: Rule by a managerial elite). The local law level is 4. There is a local starport of class Y. The local technology level is 4. No one speaks Anglic as their first language, and very few (if any) speak it at all. The local language spoken is Creole mix of Anglic and some other language (roll a second time to determine) Nation 2: This nation has government type 4 (Representative Democracy: Government by proxy). The local law level is 5. There is a local starport of class Y. The local technology level is 4. No one speaks Anglic as their first language, and very few (if any) speak it at all. The local language spoken is Old Terran language. Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Mandarin are common. Nation 3: This nation has government type 5 (Feudal Technocracy: Governmental relationships based on mutually beneficial technical activities). The local law level is 2. There is a local starport of class Y. The local technology level is 4. The world's elite speak Anglic, perhaps as their first language, but the majority speaks something else. The local language spoken is Artificial language. An invented language such as Esperanto or Basic English.
